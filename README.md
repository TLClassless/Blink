# Hello! Welcome to Blink.
### What is Blink?
Blink is a social network platform for sharing your best gameplay clips, maybe you shadowplayed a sick play from that CS:GO game you played last night? Maybe you were streaming and caught a dope moment?

Upload it to Blink and share it with your new followers!

### But Why?
Blink was made as a proof of concept social network and a personal  challenge, as I have never worked with something quite on this scale. Hopefully you like it!

### Whats the Stack?
Blink uses:
**[Svelte](https://svelte.dev/),**
**[Firebase](https://firebase.google.com/)** (User Auth, Firestore & Firebase Functions
